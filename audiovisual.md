> “All of a sudden it hit me – if there was such a thing as composing music, there could also be such a thing as composing motion. After all, there are melodic figures, why can’t there be figures of motion?”

### [STEINA AND WOODY VASULKA](http://www.vasulka.org/Videomasters/MA_index.html)

![inline](https://monoskop.org/images/thumb/1/11/Steina_Woody.jpg/250px-Steina_Woody.jpg)





The work that the Vasulkas presented at The Kitchen's original Greenwich Village location, which amounted to a handful of performances and showings each month, included a range of live documentary and experimental videos, live video performances, live [video processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_processing), media installations, and “experiments in perception.”[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steina_and_Woody_Vasulka#cite_note-9)

The Vasulkas' work at this time was colored by the artists' interest in negotiating terms like "space" in the context of video and what [Yvonne Spielman](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yvonne_Spielman&action=edit&redlink=1) call video's "image object." The Vasulkas' wide exploration of video in this [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological)regard led to apparent contrast, such as that between the [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary)-style _Participation_ series involving [footage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footage) of real-life performances (occurring in the space in front of and around the video camera), and works like _Caligrams_, in which the Vasulkas use hardware devices such as scan processors, video sequencers, and multikeyers to "play" or perform with video like a musical instrument, and in a different kind of space.

![inline](https://www.eai.org/user_files/images/artist/vasulkas_transform_xl.jpg)

> Integration of the senses. Light and sound become tactile, dimensional. Remember the scene in Videodrome where James Woods' TV bulges and pulsates - appearing to come to life out of sheer force of will? This is the primordial origin. This is video at its infancy, crying out to be loved and cherished, to be molded, trained, taught. It's the flight of electrons bent into otherworldly architecture. Light is given weight and allowed to drape over eerily familiar shapes. Completely transcendent.

### STEINA VASULKA | [SELECTED TREE CUTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlW1a0PcQZU) | 1980

"Selected Treecuts is a formal examination of the distinction between camera-generated and digital images, and a layered juxtaposition of contrasting representations of reality. The methodology of the tape is simple: a zoom lens moves slowly in and out on a group of trees, alternating between digitized and camera-generated, "real" images. The movement in the tape is produced by the automated zoom lens and rotating prism; the images switch rhythmically between camera images and digital images held briefly in computer memory. The contrast between the "real" camera images of trees and the frozen, digital computer images forms an essay in motion and stillness, the organic and the synthetic, tracing a trajectory from the photographic to the electronic."

> The Rutt/Etra Scan Processor is a real-time system which electronically alters the deflection signals that generate the television raster. Developed in the early 1970's in New York by Steve Rutt and Bill Etra, this analog scan processor loosely resembled the Scanimate, but was simplified in operation and offered at a lower cost.Steve Rutt manufactured the unit, while Bill Etra refined the scan processor concept, placing an emphasis on external voltage control of the processing modules . Its principle of operation is to intercept the sweep signals of a black and white video monitor and modulate these signals with analog control voltages .The voltage control directly modifies the sweep waveforms and is more predictable than other magnetic versions such as gluing or winding additional yokes onto the necks of black and white monitors. Images are `re-scanned' by a video camera facing the modulated display monitor for combination with other video signals and final recording to video tape.

[LZX VISIONARY - VECTOR RESCANNING EXPERIMENTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmUSb1ptCNg&list=PLbLv9LeK-rWw2gkG3qKgxiXAM_EZysDWC)

> This clip uses the LZX Visionary modular video synthesizer as a driving source for a vector display instead of a television (in this case a standard cathode-ray oscilloscope).  Modules used include two Video Waveform Generators to create horizontal and vertical control ramps (for X & Y inputs), Video Sync Generator to DC restore external video (for Z input) and provide synchronization signals to the control ramps, and Triple Video Fader & Key Generator to crossfade between control ramps and external video going to X & Y inputs of the oscilloscope.  A third oscillator for modulation controls the crossfader as well.  Video source is Casablanca (1942) played back from a DVD player.  Oscilloscope is filmed with Canon HFS100 camera.  Saturation, brightness, and contrast adjustments are made in software to view the output better --  much better results could be achieved with further fine tuning of the display and camera.  This type of effect is similar to those achievable by historical devices like the Scanimate and Rutt-Etra machines.

### Alex Rutterford, 33 (was), directed Autechre’s Gantz Graf. He works in West Hampstead, London

**How did the idea for Gantz Graf come about?**
I’d been chatting to Shaun and Rob [from Autechre] for years about this idea of interacting sound with some kind of abstract shape. Without sounding like a druggy, they were the images I saw in my head while I was on acid a long time ago.

**It’s incredibly detailed – how long did it take?**
It took me about a month to work out a technique just to animate one little thing in particular. Months and months. I used the LightWave program, a 3D animation application. An architectural student in Italy is writing a thesis on it. He wanted to know the most detailed aspects of it – it’s a bit mad really.

**Why has Warp been so successful with its videos?**
They have an aura and a mystique and a bit of an attitude which is quite rare these days. You just see more and more videos that are commonplace and banal. I cannot stand the pop trash fodder, it’s so formulaic. You have to work five times as hard to get something special. Some people expect a video that looks like bloody George Lucas has directed it.

**How obsessive are you?**
I’m a lunatic. One of the things I’m working on at the moment – it’s very sculptural – is going to take about a year to do.

![](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/206514697_1280x720.jpg)


20Hz observes a geo-magnetic storm occurring in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Working with data collected from the CARISMA radio array and interpreted as audio, we hear tweeting and rumbles caused by incoming solar wind, captured at the frequency of 20 Hertz. Generated directly by the sound, tangible and sculptural forms emerge suggestive of scientific visualisations. As different frequencies interact both visually and aurally, complex patterns emerge to create interference phenomena that probe the limits of our perception.

### [RAFAEL LOZANO-HEMMER](http://www.lozano-hemmer.com)

“I work with technology, but I really detest the term ‘new media’ because I’m fully aware of experimentation in these fields that goes back 100 years,” Mr. Lozano-Hemmer said, citing the pioneering work of the Argentine artist and writer [Marta Minujín](https://www.guggenheim.org/map-artist/marta-minujin), who was an early maker of Conceptual work with an interactive bent.

“To pretend what we’re doing is new is disingenuous.”

He cited a statistic that the average person spent at least eight hours a day in front of some kind of screen.

“Working with technology is normal, it’s natural,” he said. “If you’re living on this planet, and you want to reflect on what the concerns are, then you have to work with technology. It’s not something optional.”

### RAFAEL LOZANO-HEMMER |  [FREQUENCY AND VOLUME](https://vimeo.com/17098143) | 2003
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Frequency and Volume enables participants to tune into and listen to different radio frequencies by using their own bodies. A computerised tracking system detects participants' shadows, which are projected on a wall of the exhibition space.

The project was developed at a time when the Mexican Government was very active in shutting down informal or "pirate" radio stations in indigenous communities in the states of Chiapas and Guerrero. The question "who has access to the public space that is the radioelectric spectrum" is one that deserves attention and visualization tools not just in Mexico but also here in the developed world, where there is a remarkable assymmetry in the assignation of frequencies only to government or corporate interests to the detriment of community-building, experimental or artistic uses of the spectrum. This project was inspired by the "Manifesto for Antenna-Man" and the radio poetry experiments by the Mexican estridentista artists in the 1920s.

### [R. LUKE DUBOIS](http://www.lukedubois.com)

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
R. Luke DuBois is a composer, artist, and performer who explores the temporal, verbal, and visual structures of cultural and personal ephemera. DuBois’ method of composing is based on a fluid interaction between data, sound, and images. Conceptually, he sees musical scores as sets of data that are transformed into works of art by musical instruments.

The roots of DuBois’ overall practice stem from 1950s concept of “generative art.” Founded in the early days of computational art, generative art was created using various methods of aleatory change to create unique variations of an image, sound, or composition. DuBois’ approach to sound is influenced by conceptual artist John Cage’s theory that any sound can be music – a radical notion during this period of art history – and like Cage, uses chance operations to yield music. DuBois’ work can range from the temporal manipulation of musical performances, to data visualizations transformed into music, to the permutation of language – all of which exemplify the mercuriality of song.

### R LUKE DUBOIS | [KISS](https://vimeo.com/13792228) | 2010
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kiss (2010) takes 50 iconic embraces from the history of cinema and re-animates them through a digital rendering technique developed by the artist. The technique analyses the existing footage and references areas of the film which resemble the lips of the embracing actors. These points of reference are strung together, and the result is a sparkling digital web which plunges the familiar scenes into darkness and re-invents the actors as starlit silhouettes. As we peer into the dark, the flickering scenes emerge as semi-recognisable moments of intense cinematic romance accompanied by a re-coded and highly immersive soundtrack.

<br>
<br>
"No matter where you go these days, there are machines tracking you movements, scanning your face, this world of technology built by the government and the military," says George, an artist in residence at Eyebeam who is curating this show. "But I think the point of this exhibit is to show that it doesn't have to be some dystopian world. We can break these technologies open, we can remake them into art, we can open source them and teach everybody how they work."

[D-Fuse](http://www.dfuse.com) | [Small Global](https://vimeo.com/155224060#at=90) | 2013
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
D-Fuse are a London-based audiovisual artist collective, who use emerging creative technologies to explore social and environmental issues.

Small Global is an interactive video installation with surround sound that translates data about global interdependence, consumption and its environmental costs into an immersive environment. Multiple layers of transparent screens create an invisible cube of projected images, with the projections echoing onto the walls, ceiling and floor of the space. Members of the audience can walk around and inside the cube, their bodies becoming part of the projection surfaces. Surround sound immerses the space, and interaction sensors allow visitors to reveal visual information with their presence. Small Global signifies a global interdependence that often goes unnoticed in an environment saturated with marketing messages, which precisely these messages are designed to make us forget: The production of the goods we consume can have devastating consequences in parts of the world that we might not even be aware of.
