### Projection Mapping in Millumin |  Workshop.

---

> "Projection-mapping techniques allow you to paint real world using a simple video projector. With a single projector con- nected to a laptop and the aid of LPMT, you can project your video, images, colors to differently oriented surfaces and compensate projection distortion using deformable quads that can be adjusted directly on the screen by simply dragging their corners."

### SESSION OVERVIEW

Playing with After Effects and Millumin (projection mapping and live AV) we will create a series of mini films (3 to 5 secs). These films will be developed as a series of mapped objects, combining built, 3D forms with the mapped projections to plot out a mini instrument.

---

#### PART I

1. Open After Effects.
2. Create 800px x 800px composition (⌘N) in After Effects (approx 5 seconds).
3. Use rulers (⌘R) to split composition halfway horizontal and vertical.
4. Create 3 new 400px x 400px solids in composition (⌘Y).
5.  Arrange content in bottom two and top left of comp (not black).
<br>

<br>    
6. Import audio (⌘I)to project and drag into composition.
7. Select audio layer in comp and go to: *Animation/Keyframe Assistant/Convert Audio to Keyframes*
8. Bring down layer menu for audio amplitude and show: *effects/both channels*.
9. Bring down layer menu for one of your solids and select *transform/opacity*. Go to: *Animation/Add Expression* and drag the pick whip tool (spiral icon) to both channels on your audio amplitude layer.
10. Press the ram preview button to view your composition.

---

#### PART II

1. Develop your group response (in another comp if easier). Consider it’s cube arrangement and use track matte if necessary to utilise your square solids as masks for the created film content. (More detail in session).
2. Export your final film at it’s native size of 800px x 800px as ProRes and drop onto a pen drive.

---

#### PART III

1. Open Millumin.
2. Import quicktime into Millumin.
3. Make new composition in Millumin.
4. Drag QT into composition.
2. Click mapping tool and select the ‘show slice editor’ button on the right hand side of the screen.

<br>
5. Slice layer / comp (2 x 2).
6. Arrange your cube in front of the projector and use the mapping corner pins to align with your real-world cube (cursor keys for pixel-accurate movement).
7. Press play..

VIDEO PROJECTION TOOLS : http://ift.tt/1hP0sK3 VPT is a free multipurpose realtime projection software tool for Mac and Windows created by HC Gilje. Among other things it can be used for projecting video on complex forms, adapt a projection to a particular space/surface, combine recorded and live footage, for multiscreen HD playback, for interactive installations using arduino sensors or camera tracking ++
