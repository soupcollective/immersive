> As socially and historically produced, the categories of the live and the recorded are defined in a mutually exclusive relationship, in that the notion of the live is premised on the absence of recording and the defining fact of the recorded is the absence of the live.

### Why live visuals?

Projection design can also amplify “liveness,” perhaps the most debated quality in performance design. Elements of interactivity or real-time events, with the possible exception of live cameras, are typically avoided in “big” theatrical projection design. Exceptions are “downtown theater” groups that specialize in integrating live media into their productions, such as [The Wooster Group](https://thewoostergroup.org/blog/), [The Builders Association](https://www.thebuildersassociation.org/), [Early Morning Opera](http://earlymorningopera.com/wp/about/), et al. [The Light Surgeons](http://www.lightsurgeons.com/) are a unique group of musicians and visualists who work with cinematic narrative.

In his book Liveness, Philip Auslander relates that the personnel involved in Madonna’s tour freely admit the goal of their productions, like that of many rock and pop concerts, is to reproduce the artist’s music videos as closely as possible in a live setting on the assumption that the audience comes to the show expecting to see what it has already seen on the television. One could say that because the music video sets the standard for what is “real” in this realm, only a recreation of its imagery can count as “realistic.” Reciprocally, the fact that the images from Madonna’s videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos.

Beyond that, it is the opinion of several theater designers that when an operator’s hand is present, influencing the arc and progression of the imagery onstage, there is a sudden lack of craft detected; a level of chaos or indecision in an otherwise scripted, practiced performance.

Therefore, if the overall form of a performance aspires to a cohesive, unbroken experience — why allow any real-time, “live” visual elements? Why not favor consistency, offered by cue driven playback systems where all imagery is pre-rendered, with far less room for error or the slip of the operator’s hand (or state of mind)?

One argument is that for live performance, particularly for live music, the element of improvisation matches the energy and ephemeral quality of the performance in a way that pre-rendered and cued/time coded imagery cannot. In addition, the imagery and its delivery systems (playback software, MIDI controllers, analog mixers, and so on) can be refined and tweaked over time, similar to way music may evolve during rehearsals on a tour—fusing a symbiotic relationship between the musicians and the visualist.

The presence of real-time effects and audio-responsive imagery increases the synaesthetic relationship between image and sound, thereby creating a more “live” experience for the audience.

Live performance is made of a series moments that happen sequentially, all of which will not be remembered by the audience. Every person will remember those moments differently — like a montage, as one remembers their day or dreams.

As a live visual designer, you can control how best those moments will be delivered and perceived.

### Telematic Art



**Telematic art** is a descriptive of art projects using computer mediated [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications) networks as their medium. Telematic art challenges the traditional relationship between active viewing subjects and passive art objects by creating interactive, behavioural contexts for remote aesthetic encounters.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematic_art#cite_note-1)

In 1977 'Satellite Arts Project' by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematic_art#cite_note-4) used satellites to connect artists on the east and west coast of the United States. This was the first time that artists were connected in a [telematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematic) way. With the support of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) the artists produced composite images of participants, enabling an interactive dance concert amongst geographically disparate performers. An estimated audience of 25,000 saw bi-coastal discussions on the impact of new technologies on art, and improvised, interactive dance and music performances that were mixed in real time and shown on a split screen. These first satellite works emphasized the primacy of process that remained central to the theory and practice of telematic art.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematic_art#cite_note-5)

- [A Hole in Space LA-NY, 1980 -- the mother of all video chats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyIJJr6Ldg8)

In 1980, artists Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz (K&S) created a "Hole in Space" by linking bigger-than-life displays in New York and LA with a satellite feed. It was the mother of all video chats -- they showed that size and bandwidth matter in communicating presence and emotion. Products begin with a vision followed by an engineering prototype. If the prototype is successful, it may be followed by an expensive, restricted market product, which with further refinement, may end up a ubiquitous, mass market product. Hole in Space is an engineering prototype illustrating K&S's vision of large screen teleconferencing. Hole in Space was only one K&S project. For an overview of a quarter century of their pioneering artistic achievement, see the Electronic Cafe International archival Web site at: [http://www.ecafe.com/museum/history/k...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=SyIJJr6Ldg8&event=video_description&q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecafe.com%2Fmuseum%2Fhistory%2Fksoverview2.html&redir_token=yxFoTH6HR-7NYJSSDNO2R4ZWgAt8MTU1MjU2Mjg0OUAxNTUyNDc2NDQ5) You can see an excerpt (4m 49s) from this video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSMVt...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSMVtE1QjaU) For more information on the artists and the event, see: [http://cis471.blogspot.com/2013/12/a-...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=SyIJJr6Ldg8&event=video_description&q=http%3A%2F%2Fcis471.blogspot.com%2F2013%2F12%2Fa-hole-in-space-envisioning-and.html&redir_token=yxFoTH6HR-7NYJSSDNO2R4ZWgAt8MTU1MjU2Mjg0OUAxNTUyNDc2NDQ5)

From 1975 through 1977 artists Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz developed a series of projects under a heading they called "Aesthetic Research in Telecommunications," 1975. Among these projects was the _Satellite Arts Project_ that addressed a multitude of telecollaborative arts and virtual space performance issues that had never been genuinely tested or even experienced. Central to the _Satellite Arts Project_ idea was an aesthetic inquiry that would apply the performing arts as a mode of investigating the possibilities and limitations of various technologies to create new contexts for art, including the emergence of telecollaborative arts on a global scale. In a time when satellites were the only viable means of transmitting full-motion video across oceans in near-realtime (the global context), the artists focused equally on transmission delays over long distance networks, and performed a number of telecollaborative dance, music, and performance scores to determine what traditional genres could be supported, while exploring new genres that would emerge over time as intrinsic to these new ways of being-in-the-world.

The _Satellite Arts_ "series" of projects represents a seminal work in telecommunications art history. Not a conventional satellite broadcast of an artist/s as subject, nor a videoconference by artists. This marks the first time that the geographically dispersed electronic image was contextualized as **a live immersive place**, where artists, and others, could convene and co-create together on a scale that could be as culturally inclusive as desired.

# TELEMATIC DREAMING

'Telematic Dreaming' (1992). An interactive installation by Paul Sermon.

_Telematic Dreaming_ was a telecommunication project by Paul Sermon in which the audience had to deal with two important aspects of telecommunication: physical presence and telepresence. The project could have taken place between two beds and bedrooms that could have been located hundreds of kilometres away from each other.
