- [A Hole in Space LA-NY, 1980 -- the mother of all video chats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyIJJr6Ldg8)

In 1980, artists Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz (K&S) created a "Hole in Space" by linking bigger-than-life displays in New York and LA with a satellite feed. It was the mother of all video chats -- they showed that size and bandwidth matter in communicating presence and emotion. Products begin with a vision followed by an engineering prototype. If the prototype is successful, it may be followed by an expensive, restricted market product, which with further refinement, may end up a ubiquitous, mass market product. Hole in Space is an engineering prototype illustrating K&S's vision of large screen teleconferencing. Hole in Space was only one K&S project.

From 1975 through 1977 artists Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz developed a series of projects under a heading they called "Aesthetic Research in Telecommunications," 1975. Among these projects was the _Satellite Arts Project_ that addressed a multitude of telecollaborative arts and virtual space performance issues that had never been genuinely tested or even experienced. Central to the _Satellite Arts Project_ idea was an aesthetic inquiry that would apply the performing arts as a mode of investigating the possibilities and limitations of various technologies to create new contexts for art, including the emergence of telecollaborative arts on a global scale. In a time when satellites were the only viable means of transmitting full-motion video across oceans in near-realtime (the global context), the artists focused equally on transmission delays over long distance networks, and performed a number of telecollaborative dance, music, and performance scores to determine what traditional genres could be supported, while exploring new genres that would emerge over time as intrinsic to these new ways of being-in-the-world.

The _Satellite Arts_ "series" of projects represents a seminal work in telecommunications art history. Not a conventional satellite broadcast of an artist/s as subject, nor a videoconference by artists. This marks the first time that the geographically dispersed electronic image was contextualized as **a live immersive place**, where artists, and others, could convene and co-create together on a scale that could be as culturally inclusive as desired.
